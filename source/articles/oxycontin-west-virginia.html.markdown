When I met JR and Nikki they’d just run away from their own lives, penniless, with a backpack full of clothes and a purse containing two cans of potted meat, a packet of crackers and a syringe. They were walking down a set of train tracks between Danville and Madison at the center of West Virginia’s coal country. It was hot out. The air shimmered, thick with creosote oozing from the railroad ties.

I asked them for directions and they asked me why I was walking to Madison. I told them I was hitchhiking through southern West Virginia to learn about oxycodone, about how it had marbled through the hills of this isolated pocket of Appalachia pushing methadone clinic check ins up 500% in five years and raising the regional death rate from overdose to eight times the national average. They told me about being “D.O.A” at the ER, about smuggling almost a thousand pills a month from Florida to West Virginia and about the nightmares their toddler had after a crowbar wielding addict ripped open their front door to get at the drug safe.

We snuck down behind a little league field and I watched as JR cooked up a 20mg Roxicodone pill on a spoon and shot it into their arms using an iPhone charger to tie off. It was the 4th of July. Their pupils constricted. Nikki threw up the potted meat.
END_SUMMARY

Two days prior, I’d arrived in West Virginia after anxiously drinking too much scotch while stuffing a tent in a backpack and falling asleep on a little twin jet bullied by storm clouds into Charleston’s Yeager Airport. It was hot out – that muggy heat that clots pores until they ooze. And I was exhilaratingly fearful – alone and sunscreen-less at the baggage claim, intent on spending the next seven days hitchhiking through the state’s southern mountains looking for stories about the region’s opioid epidemic.

Appalachia’s coal country isn’t so much a place as an umbrella term for the geographically unique region spreading across the border between West Virginia and Eastern Kentucky. Here, over thousands of years, rivers and their tributaries have eaten away at the Appalachian plateau, forming steep mountain walls that dive into narrow snaking valleys. From above, this lush terrain ripples and twists like a bulldog’s back. On the ground, it has an almost claustrophobic quality, with human settlement forced into scarce pockets of flat land where whole communities can consist of no more than a collection of trailers on a river’s bend. 

It’s nightmarish for hitchhiking. Pick-up trucks careen around shoulderless hairpin turns. You have to listen carefully, to predict when they’ll round the bend and be ready to jump into the opposing lane or splay yourself against the roadside rocks. The sweat dries in salt stains beneath your eyes. Drivers rarely stop. There’s a fear, they say, a fear of outsiders, a fear of the drugs. Coal trains echo through quiet, wild nights.

I was headed east toward Hamlin when I caught my first ride. Becky was round, with limp, thinning blonde hair and sun slapped skin. I sat in the back next to one of two kids. He stared. Becky smoked. The Pontiac struggled.

Becky’s “Lil’ Sis’” was a teenager when they prescribed Oxycontin for her endometriosis. And it was the boys at her school that showed her how to crush and snort them.

“It happened so quickly,” Becky said.

Lil’ Sis’ would come round the house to “see the baby” but steal jewelry and cash while no one was looking. Fraud and burglary became a part of her life and, twelve years later, they locked her up on multiple counts of theft.

“(Lil’ Sis’) had the kid just before she went in,” Becky said, and it took three days until the newborn even began to show withdrawal symptoms. They had it on life support for 14 days before it went home with a little infant methadone kit. 

Unfortunately, Lil’ Sis’ story is not uncommon. Of the 115 babies born at Welch County, 
WV’s community hospital in 2011, over 40 percent had been exposed to drugs and, in McDowell County, the school district says 46 percent of children live without a biological parent.

The web of factors responsible for this drug epidemic is complex. Yet, at its root, we see a cycle of poverty that, for so much of recent history, has gripped a region largely controlled and exploited by outside forces. 

150 years ago, the southern Appalachian mountains stood as one of the east coast’s last great strongholds of rural frontier life. With the rise in demand for steel, however, by 1900, 90 percent of the coal rich land in Mingo and Wayne counties was owned by outside capitalists. Today, absentee corporations control more than half the total land in West Virginia’s nine southernmost counties.

Over 600 company towns were constructed between 1900 and 1930. They outnumbered independent incorporated towns five to one. Political organizations came under the control of company owners and policy was directed toward economic interests. Mountain men became company men. They toiled beneath the earth, sucking black dust and pinching off the occasional limb at the joint. They purchased groceries from the company store, visited the company doctor and sent their kids to the company school.

As one might expect, mining profits did not trickle down. By the mid-twentieth century, coal country had become emblematic of entrenched American poverty. It was a visit to the region that so unsettled Kennedy in 1960, sparking a promise that led to Johnson’s “unconditional war on poverty” in 1964.

Yet, throughout the latter half of the twentieth century regional mining jobs continued to decline, towns withered and welfare became a way of life. At the time, forecasts for the region were dark. And then in 1996, when pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma brought the sustained-release opiate OxyContin to market, they quickly got a whole lot darker. 

From the day of its release, OxyContin has provided little or no advantage over existing opiate preparations. Yet from 1996 to 2000, annual sales grew from $48 million to $1.1 billion and, by 2004, it was the most abused prescription opiate in the country. 

Purdue’s secret was an unprecedentedly aggressive marketing campaign targeted toward patients with non-malignant pain – as a treatment for things like chronic back pain as opposed to things like bone cancer. OxyContin, they said, was a ‘slow-release’ preparation of oxycodone. Crushing the tablets, of course, quickly put an end to that. 

Purdue targeted their marketing at physicians with large numbers of chronic pain patients, the type of patient that coal mines were known to create. They established a starter patient coupon program that provided free, limited-time OxyContin prescriptions for 7 to 30 days and distributed promotional items such as OxyContin fishing hats, stuffed plush toys and “Get in the Swing With OxyContin” CDs. Over five years, they paid more than 5000 physicians to attended over 40 national pain-management and speaker-training conferences designed to promote their product.

In response, from 1997 to 2002, Oxycontin prescriptions for non-malignant pain rose from around 670,000 to 6.2 million annually. By 2002, unintentional overdose deaths from prescription opioids surpassed those from heroin and cocaine nationally and, in West Virginia, prescription rates were running close to 5 times the national average. The demand was massive. Coal country saw the rise of what came to be known as pill mills – physicians’ practices that write unwarranted opiate prescriptions for financial gain. For the residents, OxyContin was a pain reliever, it was an escape and, perhaps above all, it was a business opportunity that, in both legal and illegal markets, proved itself wildly ripe.

My new acquaintance JR was eight years old when he first heard about OxyContin, 15 when he got his first opioid prescription and 18 when his mom first sat him down and shot him up on his birthday.

“She said she did it because she knew I’d be doing it,” he said. “You know, she wanted to make sure I did it right.”

Today JR is 25. He’s been dating Nikki for seven years. He’s got a tattoo wrapping around his eye and the words ‘Faith’ and ‘Hope’ etched across his knuckles. All three tattoos came from ink-dipped staples behind bars.

Nikki is short, round and drawled, with near-black roots popping from beneath near-gold hair. In 2008, her dad and uncle went into business buying OxyContin prescriptions from pill mills in Florida and trafficking them up to coal country. Demand outpaced supply and, since Nikki and JR were struggling financially, her dad soon asked JR to join the venture.

“You could take fifteen hundred dollars down there,” JR said, “pay for your doctors appointment and all your prescriptions, hotel for a night, and you can come back up here and sell 180 30s in less than a day for $5,400.”

JR always names pills by their concentration. ‘180 30s’ refers to 180 30mg pills.

The three men worked in a rotating schedule, each driving to Florida once every three weeks. Once back in Beckley, WV, JR handled distribution from the apartment where he and Nikki lived with their infant son. He was selling a lot of pills, and he was shooting a lot pills.

Driving back from Florida one time, he nodded off after shooting a 30 in the back seat with a lit cigarette in his hand. His whole crotch was ablaze before the driver noticed and woke him up. Instead of putting it out, JR just started singing happy birthday to the driver’s daughter sitting in the front seat.

“I used to have to have five 30s in the morning or I’d start to get sick,” he said.

Then one night, after locking the drug safe and retiring to the living room, Nikki heard one of their baby’s toys squeak from across the apartment. So, she walked over to the bedroom.

“And there was a guy standing there,” she said. “He had a bandana on all the way around his face. He had latex gloves on and a crowbar and a metal pipe.” 

They’d forgotten to slide the deadbolt and three men had popped the lock with a credit card. JR came running in but one of them quickly pinned him to the couch with the crowbar while the other two carried out the safe. Nicki screamed, the men told her to “shut the fuck up” and the baby wailed each night for the next couple months.

In 2010, Nikki took a job at the Beckley Pain Clinic, well regarded as a local pill mill.

“Me and the nurse practitioner alone, we seen a hundred patients alone a day,” she said. “People would just go in there and tell (the doctor) that they wanted 120 30s, 120 15s and he’d just give them to him.” 

Often, the doctor would just sign prescriptions from behind closed doors and give them to the nurses to distribute. Sometimes patients didn’t even have to come into the office. JR started paying patients to pick up prescriptions Nikki wrote, giving them 40 of the pills for free and keeping the other 80.

For a couple years, life ran smooth. But then, in two quick strokes, the whole foundation of JR and Nikki’s operation started rotting out. First, Florida made it illegal for people to get prescriptions for opiates with out of state IDs. There were still drug dealers they could work through, but the costs – and the steaks – were much higher. Second, the Beckley pain clinic got investigated and Nikki was fired. Just like that, JR said, within a matter of months, “I went from having anything I wanted to not having nothing.”

Without pills, Nikki and JR got desperate quick. “Your body will just, like, ache and you’ll have like these sicknesses,” Nikki said, “of, like, using the bathroom and throwing up until you get it.”

JR tried taking a job at Arby’s but one day, being dope sick, “the smell of grease, I started… I had to puke,” and he vomited out the drive-thru window. He lost another job after stealing a carton of cigarettes and giving them to his mom who attempt to return them to get cash for pills.

“It came to the point,” Nikki said, “that we’re not allowed back in Wal-Marts because we stole so much stuff out of them.”

“I walked straight out of Wal-Mart, two days in a row, with twenty five hundred dollars worth of electronics,” JR said. “I just put it in a buggy and walked out. Second time I got caught.”

“If I made a $200 check, we’d spend 170 of it on drugs in two days and be broke for a week and a half,” Nikki said.

“I stole medicine out of my grandfather’s cabinet after he got knee surgery.”

“I can’t even tell you how many bad checks we wrote.”

Eventually, as restrictions on OxyContin got tighter and tighter in coal country, heroin started filling the gap. It was cheap and it was powerful.

“One time we’d just re-up’d and we were with another guy and, uh, we all did it,” Nikki said, “there was four of us in there and I did my bag first and when I got done I just fell over in the back seat of the car … and my face went blue and everything, instantly, and the guy that we was with he was on parole and ... he got out of the car and picked me up and threw me out into the snow and just left me and, by the time the ambulance got there 15 minutes later, I was “dead on arrival”. They barely had enough time to bring me back.”

“I was giving her CPR when the cops came,” JR said. He had two warrants out for his arrest and they brought him in. The police attempted to spin attempted murder but JR was out on bail in less than a week. The night of his release he wound up “dead on arrival” at the same hospital from the same batch of heroin.

In September of last year, JR was convicted of cutting down over 400 feet of telephone cable in order to extract the copper wire for pill money. “Like I said, I cut the phone lines down – 7,000-8,000 people without phone line service including the main dispatch to the state police station.”

Soon afterwards, they lost custody of their son and the narcotics department came sniffing around. They tried to go clean but they fumbled. The drugs were everywhere around them. Finally, in a moment of desperation, they ran away from Beckley, from the life, from the drugs. And the next morning, walking on the train tracks, I asked them for directions.

“I hate that I got addicted,” Nikki said after I watched her shoot up in the grass being the little league field. “I want to quit so bad, but I’d rather have a pill then a place to sleep at night.” 

“If we get high for the day we don’t even care if we eat,” JR said. “We would rather have our fix than eat.”

It was around noon at this time on the 4th of July and a couple kids and their Dad’s had arrived to play ball. JR and I stood up. Nikki finished puking up the potted meat. We shook hands and said goodbye. I have no idea what happened to them next.

I hitched toward Oceana, or Oxyana as people call it and, over the next couple days, south toward Welch. Locals discussed how recent carbon regulations put in place by the EPA have sped up the already shrinking coal mine job market to an alarming pace – entire towns folding as the region’s most important industry dries up beneath their feet.

“Almost everyone you see around here is now unemployed,” says the owner of Flint’s Hardware in Sylvester, WV. “Even those of us not in the mines are now starting to have to think about what we’re gonna do because without the mines… I don’t know.”

“That’s all there is here is coal,” said Lorraine Garvey, a lifelong resident of Whitesville, WV. “There’s nothing else to do.”

“It’s killing my business,” says Brian Patterson of BWs Barber Shop in Welch, WV. “80 percent of my business is coal miners.”

“For every coal mining job that goes, there’s 10 other jobs that goes with it,” says Bernie of Bernie’s Cole Street Deli in Logan, WV. “I’m 56, been here my whole life and I’ve never before seen it this bad.” Bernie went out of business on August 1st.

Hitching southwest from Bob White, WV, I was picked up by a laid off coal miner smoking weed in a truckers cap. Driving on hairpin turns with country music blasting from his pickup truck, we got to laughing. He offered me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich but, when we got to his trailer, he said his wife was junk sick and I should leave.

 “Besides,” she said, smoking a cigarette and staring me down behind a purple robe in the dimly lit kitchen, “it’s not like we got no bread.”
